_ Metamethods do not appear to be working...
_ Parse nested tables with no commas correctly : a = ( ( 2 3 ) ( 4 5) )   _ this currently fails. You must add a comma.
_ Consider adding unary - to number literals.  : a = (0 0 -9.8) _ currently fails because sees expression "0 - 9.81"

X a: (expr) does not work!
    Table expressions needed to reset fs->freereg

X Reverse "all calls have 'self'" to increase compatibility and reduce number of changes

Separate <unknown> indexs from <nil> values
Table entries are ordered, integer indexing returns value at that position. Table entries can be without key...
 
Method vs non-method calls
    _- Cystem (de)referencing -_ 
    a. _ Value a is a reference to
    _.a _ Reference used to point to a 
    .a _ Value is mutable

    name args  _ no parent
    .module.name args  _ non method escape call
    func a.b() {} _ method def
    a: func(){}   _ non method def
    func a(){}    _ non method def
    (b:func(){} ) _ method def
    a.b() _ method call


_ Check for solutions to setlist when stack has grown a bit for tableconstructor

try for (paramlist):{block} style lamda expressions (presently func(paramlist){block}
